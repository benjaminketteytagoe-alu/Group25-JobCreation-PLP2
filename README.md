Pantry Vault is a command-line-based software application designed to help individuals, especially beginners, foreigners, or everyday cooks, easily manage recipes, discover simple dishes, and store personal favorites from select countries in Africa.

## Application overview
### Goals:
1. Cultural preservation: as the cooking and all related matters are part of the culture, they tend to fade away as time goes by, which helps to conserve the culture.
2. Recipes: everyone likes to try new, good, and enjoyable meals, and everyone is going to explore the recipes all over Africa. 
Beginners platform: the beginners are not going to worry as long as about recipes and how to cook them, all they have to do is join them and then explore the recipes.
